## Project Description
The purpose of this poejct goal was to demostrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal was to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis based on some parameters (to be described later in this Codebook).

##Study design and data processing

###Collection of the raw data
The raw data was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

##Creating the tidy datafile

###Guide to create the tidy data file
Description on how to create the tidy data file (1. download the data, ...)/
1. Download the data from the following URL: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
2. Extract the .zip file into a working directory (you should get a UCI HAR Dataset folder
3. Run run_analysis.R file (see ReadMe.md file for more details)


###Cleaning of the data



##Description of the variables in the tiny_data.txt file
General description of the file including:
 - Dimensions of the dataset
 - Summary of the data
 - Variables present in the dataset

(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)

###Variable 1 (repeat this section for all variables in the dataset)
Short description of what the variable describes.

Some information on the variable including:
 - Class of the variable
 - Unique values/levels of the variable
 - Unit of measurement (if no unit of measurement list this as well)
 - In case names follow some schema, describe how entries were constructed (for example time-body-gyroscope-z has 4 levels of descriptors. Describe these 4 levels). 

(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)

####Notes on variable 1:
If available, some additional notes on the variable not covered elsewehere. If no notes are present leave this section out.

##Sources
Sources you used if any, otherise leave out.

##Annex
If you used any code in the codebook that had the echo=FALSE attribute post this here (make sure you set the results parameter to 'hide' as you do not want the results to show again)
